Pledgeball is a UK based sustainability-focused football charity that encourages fans to make eco friendly pledges on match days. Our data science consulting team partnered with Pledgeball to analyse 200,000+ fan engagement records from July 2020 to January 2025, aiming to understand what drives pledges and how fan engagement could be amplified across leagues, regions and match timings.Our goal was simple but powerful: How can data help Pledgeball increase its impact, motivating more fans to pledge and amplifying sustainability in football?

**Key Questions We Set Out to Answer**:

1. Which teams, leagues and regions are the most engaged with sustainability campaigns?
2. When do fans make the most pledges — by time of day, day of week or season?
3. What insights can we uncover to help Pledgeball plan campaigns more effectively?
4. How can data be used to guide partnerships with football clubs for greater outreach?

**Supporting Technologies**:

1. Languages: Python, R
2. Visualisation: Tableau
3. Data Handling: Microsoft Excel
4. Team Collaboration: GitHub, Google Drive, PowerPoint
 
**Methodology & Approach**:

Our workflow blended business context with technical depth:
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation: Processed a dataset of 219,000+ pledges (953 events) using R. Created new variables for gender, region and league classification. Cleaned inconsistent text data and merged duplicate pledge types.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducted temporal, geographic and demographic analysis using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) and Tableau for interactive visualisations.
3. Collaboration & Stakeholder Management: I managed a team of 5 data science consultants, coordinating with client stakeholders weekly and ensuring clarity between technical analysis and strategic recommendations.

**Deliverables**:

1. Technical report summarising the key findings in-depth.
2. Tableau dashboard for interactive exploration of the trends observed in our analysis.
3. Client presentation with strategic recommendations for the organisation.


**Insights & Results**:

Our analysis uncovered several actionable patterns:
1. Timing Matters: 83% of UK pledges were made on weekends, with peak engagement at 1PM and 7PM which aligns with usual football match schedules.
2. Seasonality Trends: Most pledges occurred in January and February, indicating strong alignment with the football season and climate awareness events.
3. Top Performing Teams: Just 5 clubs (Northampton Town, Manchester United, Forest Green, Bristol City, Norwich City) accounted for 35% of the UK submissions; smaller, community driven clubs often showed stronger engagement.
4. Regional Hotspots: The North West and London emerged as regions with the highest pledge volumes.
5. Impact Projection: Our targeted campaign recommendations were estimated to increase engagement by 15–20%, earning positive client feedback for clarity and strategic depth.


This project taught me more than just data cleaning or visualisation. It highlighted the importance of connecting analytics with real-world impact, how small teams can create data stories that drive strategy and the power of clear communication — translating R scripts and Tableau dashboards into insights that non technical stakeholders could act on. This experience reinforced my belief that data science can be a bridge between insight and social change. It’s not just about accuracy, it’s about action. Even small shifts in our day-to-day behaviour and habits can create meaningful impact on global sustainability.
